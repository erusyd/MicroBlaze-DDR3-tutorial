# Demo HW design of MicroBlaze using DDR3 RAM on Arty A7

The folder [ArtyA7_MicroBlaze_demo_hw](ArtyA7_MicroBlaze_demo_hw) contains the HW design project created by the [tutorial](../README.md).

The design was made in Vivado 2023.1 and tested on Arty A7-35 (which is no longer in production).

**If you have [Arty A7-100](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-a7-100t-artix-7-fpga-development-board/), you need to change the board to A7-100 in Tools|Settings|General|Project device.** No other changes in the design should be necessary.
