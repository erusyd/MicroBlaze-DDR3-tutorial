# ArtyA7-MicroBlaze-demo

This is demo HW design of [MicroBlaze](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/microblaze.html) on a [Digilent Arty A7 board](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-a7-100t-artix-7-fpga-development-board/).

Included application is a benchmarking tool for memory read speed.

The design was done in Vivado 2023.1 and Vitis 2023.1.

Tested on Arty A7-35 (no longer in production) but should be easy to port to Arty A7-100.
